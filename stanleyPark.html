                  Over 4 months, I explored the basic functions of Android Studio such as intents, sensor access, saving user information, and implementation of Google Maps. It was an individual project, and I was <em>able to create my app in a month.</em>

               <p>
                  This app was created as a prototype for <em>locals and tourists</em> who want to know more about the importance of Stanley Park landmarks to the First Nations people.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Each piece shows the description provided by the City of Vancouver's website, and below, <em>ideally First Nations people are able to log in and input additional meanings or stories into the database.</em> When users press "show more", that information will appear.

                  I planned most of the app through <em>site maps</em> and listing out the concepts in order to carry out the <em>functionality</em> to link to other events. The structure of the site map also helped me understand the basic <em>user flow.</em> I planned out my UI through <em>Illustrator</em> to help visualize the basic user experience of how people are taken through the app.

                  I was able to learn <em>basic Android functionality of an app</em> and how to interact with different screens and other apps. The theoretical part of Android is quite simple, but the actual implementation is quite difficult using Android Studio (as with most code).

                  Learning Android Studioâ€™s <em>syntax</em> even with previous Java experience. For basic tasks, <em>researching on the web</em> were needed. In-class resources were not sufficient enough as concepts were well explained, but execution was not taught.
               </p>
               <p>
                  After a few weeks, I decided to relocate my image folder and remove some images. My app still worked, but <em>no images would show.</em> I ended up redoing the entire project, by using a Card View tutorial online and salvaging code from my previous file. Unfortunately, I did not have GitHub at this time.

                  Understanding how the concept of <em>shared preferences</em> work in relation to how it is executed in the code. This problem also occurred for understanding how to implement <em>SQLite databases</em> because it needed many extra folders and reference variables.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The <em>card view</em> feature was a bonus, but its relationship to the <em>recycler view</em> and the database is still not quite clear after the many attempts of linking them all together.
