            <h5>November 2017</h5>
            <p>
               An <em>informational app</em> on Stanley Park, designed for locals and tourists who want to know the <em>meanings behind particular landmarks</em> or art pieces from a First Nations perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
               The current City of Vancouver Website (as of Fall 2017) only explains what each landmark and art piece is, but does not explain why it is important to First Nations People.

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
               Over the semester (4 months), we explored the basic functions of Android Studio such as intents, sensor access, saving user information, and implementation of Google Maps. As this was an individual project, I was able to create my app in <em>a month.</em>

               Most of my planning was done through <em>site maps</em> and listing out the concepts in order to carry out the <em>functionality</em> to link to other events. I planned out my UI through Illustrator to help visualize the basic user experience of how people are taken through the app.

            <h3>Take-aways</h3>
            <p>
               I was able to learn <em>basic Android functionality of an app</em> and how to interact with different screens and other apps. The theoretical part of Android is quite simple, but the actual implementation is quite difficult using Android Studio (as with most code).

            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
            <p>
               Learning Android Studioâ€™s <em>syntax</em> was difficult as a beginner, even with previous Java experience. Because it has so many built in strings that perform legitimate tasks, I had to resort to <em>searching online</em> for a lot of basic questions. Without the help of existing code from class, it would have taken me much longer to implement all functionality such as the Recycler and Card View, and the user log-in details.
            </p>
            <p>
               After the 2nd milestone of implementing all functionality of the app, I decided to relocate my image folder and remove some previous images. My app still worked, but <em>no images would show.</em> I ended up redoing the entire process, by using a Card View tutorial online and salvaging code from my 2nd milestone. That was not a delightful experience.
